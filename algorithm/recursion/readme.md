#  Recursion

*  Popular computing technique in a divide and conquer approach to solve a problem.  

*  The recursive approach divides the problem into simpler subsets until the base case reached.  A stack of recursive calls are held in memory and then unstacked after the base case is reached.  When a base case is not reached or the stack is greater than working memory an error occurs known as "stack overflow".
