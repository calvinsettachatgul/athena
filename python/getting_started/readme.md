##  Python import statement

*  example of importing a module in python

*  from datetime import datetime

*  now = datetime.now()

*  print now.year

*  print now.month

*  print now.day

    *  from the above example we import into the the symbol datetime the module or package datetime

    *  in general we can write
      >  from module_name import symbol

    *  this gives us the added methods that come with the datetime package including instantiating a date that is datetime.now()

    *  printing out the year, month and day with the subsequent date object calls.

*  The above code is located in the file print_now.py

*  You'll see an output similar to this:
