# Ruby

*  High level scripting language

*  Fairly heavy with built in functions as opposed to Java and C++

### Ruby Array

*  An Array is an ordered list of data

>  arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

*  Ruby provides ways to access the element of an array with a 0 ordered indexing system

>  first_index = 0

>  arr[first_index]  => ouput: 1

>  second_index = 1

>  arr[second_index] => output: 2
