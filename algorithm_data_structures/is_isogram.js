 * An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.
 *
 * isIsogram( "Dermatoglyphics" ) == true
 * isIsogram( "aba" ) == false
 * isIsogram( "moOse" ) == false // -- ignore letter case
